# ExpensePro
> _What is the project?_ - The ExpensePro project is an Expense Tracker that is accessible on a mobile device. It will allow users to keep tracks of money outflow 

> _What is the MVP ?_ - The minimal viable product is an expense tracker that perform data saving based on a user input and show the user the results

> _What are the sprinkles?_ - The sprinkles involves styling the expense tracker, taking keyboard presses as input and showing data in a statistically organized Pie Chart.
